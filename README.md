2. After you have cloned your forked version navigate into the `clean-code-adventure` folder.
3. Install node_modules: `$ yarn install`.

## Run tests
1. After you successfully cloned the project and installed thhe node_modules you can run the tests with `$ yarn test`. On the first run of this command all tests should be red.

3. After you are confident that your code is working you can run `$ yarn test` again. 
4. Continue coding until every test is green!
